# PH-Classifier-Challenge
The pH Classifier Challenge. This challenge is for anyone in the club to complete and get the highest validation accuracy. Download the data from here: https://www.kaggle.com/robjan/ph-recognition.

The challenge is to get higher than 62% validation accuracy, which is the highest that Michael Batavia received when he was testing some callbacks for his own algorithm.

In order to get the best accuracy, it is recommended to look at different callbacks when fitting your model to know when it should stop training. When completing this challenge, put your solution in a seperate branch and ask to pull request it so the admins of the club can pull it into the master branch.

Get a greater accuracy than the python notebook or file listed in the master branch!

Notice: If you are uploading a python file, make sure to include your accuracy for your classifier. If using a .ipynb notebook from Colaboratory, make sure you print the accuracy or place it in the metadata.
